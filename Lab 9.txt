Application name: Film Portal


Application Description


The main functionality of our project will be posting reviews and ratings for movies. You can search for movies and mark if you have watched them or not. If you have them marked as watched, you can post reviews and ratings. You can also bookmark movies to watch later. You will have a full profile that displays a profile picture, bio, favorite genres, etc….


The social media part of it will function somewhat similar to instagram. You can add friends so that you can see their reviews and ratings for movies. You will also have a timeline that shows recently posted reviews/ratings from your friends so you can see what movies that they have been watching. 




Vision Statement: For movie watchers, who need a place to discuss and share movies with others. The Film Portal is a social media that brings people together through their love of movies . Unlike Letterbox, our product is for every movie in recorded history, not limited to certain services.


Development Methodology: We decided on using agile methodology because it makes the most sense for weekly meetings.


Communication Plan: We have decided to use text message to communicate quickly and discord to post more extensive communications
