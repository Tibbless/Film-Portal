Steps for testing user acceptance criteria

For User acceptance criteria, we will be testing three workflows.
1. Account registration
2. Login workflows
3. Review creation


Begin by giving a description of the purpose of the website:
    It is like a social media for people who like watching films
    and want to see what films their friends are watching, and what
    they thought about the films.



For each step, ask if they had any trouble finding anything or if
    there was somewhere they expected something to be, but it was
    not there.


1. For account registration, navigate to the registration page,
    then ask the user to create an account. The content of the 
    data is not important, we want to make sure it is clear what
    needs to happen

2. After account registration, ask the user to log in. They should
    have been redirected to the login page after registration, but
    if not, watch to see how they navigate to that page.

3. After they have sucessfully logged in, ask them to create a Review
    for a movie they enjoy or have watched recently. Try to get them
    to use a real movie, but the body of the review data is not important
    if they cannot think of a movie, suggest something simple, like Cars
    or Terminator


At the end ask for possible feedback with the flow of the page and
    where they might move buttons/layout of the page to allow for
    ease of access.
